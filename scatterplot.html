<p>Without the data from April 2016 to June 2016 & March April 2017 to July of 2017 it is very different to draw a conclusion because Bike shares during the summer time is a very vital measurement for comparing data to that of the winter season. Looking at this data one might conclude that all data remains the same except for the number of one way trips. But if we take a closer look ALL the data in general declines by a very small amount.</p>
